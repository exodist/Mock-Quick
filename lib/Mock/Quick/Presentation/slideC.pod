=head2 METHOD AUTOVIVIFYING

Sometimes you need to pass in an object that has more methods than you care to
mock out, they only need to be present and return something.

Thats where the next feature of Quick Objects comes in. Quick objects
will autovivify methods as they are needed. The new methods will be read/write
accessors.

    my $obj = qobj();
    $obj->foo( 'bar' );
    is( $obj->foo, 'bar', "foo attribute was set" );
    is(
        $obj->foo( 'baz' ),
        'baz',
        "remembers and returns whatever argument you give it."
    );
