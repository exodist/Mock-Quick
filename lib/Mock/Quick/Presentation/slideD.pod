=item Autovivifying can be bad

=item Autovivification has been reported as a bug in hashes

For cases where you do not want autovivifying you can use strict objects. A
strict object will not autovivify.

    my $obj = qstrict( foo => 'foo' );
    is( $obj->foo, 'foo' );
    dies_ok { $obj->bar } "no bar() method defined";

=head3 But what if you want to change the specification later?

Easy!

in list context C<qobj> and C<qstrict> return both the new object, and a
control object that provides a manipulation interface.

    my ( $obj, $control ) = qstrict( foo => 'foo' );
    $control->set_attributes( bar => 'bar' );

=head3 Why not just provide a manipulation interface as a method on the object?

because it might conflict with the api you are attempting to mock.
