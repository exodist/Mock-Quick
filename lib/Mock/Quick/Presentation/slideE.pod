=head2 CUSTOM METHODS

More often than not you need to mock out methods more complicated than
accessors. You can add them to your quick object in 2 ways.

You can't just assign a coderef to an accessor, that would just result in an
accessor that returns a coderef. This is important because there are cases
where that is what you really want.

The original way to create a custom method is the C<qmeth()> function.

    $obj->new_method( qmeth {
        my $self = shift;
        ...
        return 'whatever';
    });

This will add a method that will be run next time you call
C<$obj-E<gt>new_method>.

Arguments will not be used to replace the method on the object like they would
a in a get/set accessor.

Some people have expressed displeasure with this API. C<qmeth {...}> seems too
magical. The alternative is to use the control object.

    my ( $obj, $control ) = qobj(...);
    $control->set_methods( foo => sub { ... });
